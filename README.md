# ERP Setup Guide
Step 1: Creating React App
```bash
npx create-react-app erp
```

Step 2: Installing Dependencies
```bash
cd erp
npm i react-router-dom bootstrap bootstrap-icons react-big-calendar moment
```

Step 3: Updating Source Code
If there's an existing "src" directory, delete it. Then, clone the "src" folder from the repository and place it inside the "erp" directory.

To run the application, use the following command in the terminal:
```bash
npm start
```
The application will be accessible at localhost:3000.
